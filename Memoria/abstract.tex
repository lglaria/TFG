\vspace{1cm}

Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2008, and the growth of investments in crypto-currencies in 2012, the Blockchain protocol has created a great interest for its possible applications in various fields.

This paper will focus on the mathematical foundations of this technology and it's relation to certain problems of distributed programming  rather than in the economic features of crypto-currencies. In order to achieve this objective the operation and correctness of a possible Blockchain specification is studied. An implementation of Blockchain was created, where it was possible to develop in practice some ideas of this document.
